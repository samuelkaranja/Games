      "Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool are not playing as a team and need to reinvent themselves after defeat to Napoli",
    information:
      "The Reds got their Champions League group stage campaign off to the worst possible start in southern Italy, with last season's runners-up finding themselves 3-0 down at half-time due to Piotr Zielinski's penalty and goals from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Giovanni Simeone. That three-goal margin could have been four had Alisson Becker not saved Victor Osimhen's first-half penalty - but Napoli found that fourth goal immediately after half-time as Zielinski tapped home. Luis Diaz's consolation goal could only spark a small revival. It was really tough to take but I would say not that difficult to explain, Klopp told BT Sport. Firstly, Napoli played really well and we didn't. That is the first explanation for the defeat. The two penalties we concede, they were both a little unlucky. The next two goals we concede are handed to them on a plate. That is not cool and we should have defended better in the first place and, of course, in the last moment as well. Liverpool's next match sees them take on Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday and Klopp believes Bruno Lage's side should be laughing at the prospect of playing his side. We need to reinvent ourselves, the Reds boss added. There are a lot of things lacking, not in all games but the fun thing is we have to do it in the middle of the Premier League season and a Champions League campaign. We need a set-up to be better in pretty much everything. We have to play in three days against Wolves. If Wolves saw that game tonight they would not stop laughing and would say it is the perfect moment.",

West Ham United are pleased to announce the signing of Italian international defender Emerson, a club statement read. Palm trees. The 28-year-old joined the Hammers for an undisclosed fee from fellow Premier League club Chelsea on a four-year deal with a one-year option. A pacy and technically proficient left-back or left wing-back renowned for his stamina and attacking qualities, Emerson has won the UEFA European Championship, UEFA Champions League, and UEFA Europa League during a stellar career.",

The Frenchman has scored 12 goals and put in 18 assists in 96 games since moving from nice.

    title: "Chelsea's Cucurella balks at haircut 'My style'",
    information:
      "Marc Cucurella may have found himself on the Stamford Bridge turf after a painful tug of his hair by Tottenham Hotspur's Cristian Romero over the weekend, but the Chelsea defender said on Wednesday that he has no plans to get a haircut. Cucurella had his long locks pulled by Romero shortly before Harry Kane leveled the Premier League match in stoppage time in the 2-2 draw, leading to a furious Thomas Tuchel saying referee Anthony Taylor should not officiate Chelsea's matches in the future. When asked if he would ever get a haircut to avoid a similar fate in the future, Cucurella grinned and told reporters: No, no, never! This is my style. Cucurella, however, said that Romero's pull was a clear red card. For me it was clear and the video was clear, sometimes referees make good decisions, and sometimes they don't, but this is not my problem. I am focused on the game, he added. I saw in the stadium they were checking for a red card and me it was very clear, but this is football. In this game, it was an error, in another game the referee would take a good decision. I have no problem with him [Romero], it was only one action in the game. But maybe it was an important action because it's possible to change the final result. Cucurella signed for Chelsea in a reported £62 million deal in the close season from Brighton & Hove Albion and the Spaniard conceded it was a lot of money and a big responsibility for him. I'm very happy to be here, he said. [Chelsea owner] Todd [Boehly] and the gaffer were so interested in me coming here. I need to work hard, adapt to the team and have this will to win and play well for the club",

      "BLUE CAMP Chelsea transfer targets De Jong and Aubameyang to hold crunch talks with Barcelona as double exit nears",
    information:
      "De Jong’s agents jetted into Barcelona on Wednesday to talk to the club, with both parties in a financial stand-off. Chelsea is now the favorite to beat Manchester United to Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong for around £67.7million. Auba, who only signed from Arsenal in January, has also instructed his advisers to speak to the LaLiga giants to decide on his next move. Chelsea is now in a race with Manchester United for Dutch midfielder De Jong, who was verbally abused by several Barca fans as he arrived at the club’s HQ for training. Reports from Spain claimed the supporters insulted him with the taunt, “Lower your salary, b****!” Barcelona needs to sell more players to balance the books and allow their summer signings to be registered ahead of their first game against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. Chelsea is willing to match United’s agreed £72m bid for De Jong, while their interest in Aubameyang is a shock. The Gabon striker, who has three years left on his contract, had a string of disciplinary issues with Arsenal but Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel worked with him at Dortmund. The Blues are already confident of signing Leicester’s Wesley Fofana and have been quoted £12m for Inter Milan’s teenage star Cesare Casadei — even though he has yet to play for the first team. Chelsea has already spent a massive £178m this summer under new owner Todd Boehly. The club’s American backers have invested in Raheem Sterling from Man City for £50m, Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli for £34m, and Marc Cucurella from Brighton for £62m. The club has also recruited Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa for £20m and Gabriel Slonina from Chicago Fire for £12m. Meanwhile, Timo Werner claims he “had a good time” at Chelsea despite failing to hit his best form. The German striker, 26, yesterday completed his £20m return to RB Leipzig — two years after he arrived for £48m. Manchester United agreed to a £72million fee to sign De Jong last month but he is owed £17m in deferred wages and will not agree to leave until he is paid. Barcelona would prefer him to stay but only if he agrees to take a significant pay cut and accept a £6m settlement for his deferred wages. The club even alleged there had been criminality in the terms agreed in the contract made by the previous board. That sparked a furious response from the Dutch players’ union, who said De Jong might be the target of extortion.",
